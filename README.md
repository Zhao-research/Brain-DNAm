# Brain DNA methylation, APOE genotype, and AD neuropathology: findings from a large cohort of postmortem human brain tissue samples

The programs shown here were used to pre-process the brain DNA methylation (assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 kits) and perform downstream analyses (e.g., EWAS, AD prediction, meta-analysis, mediation analysis, enrichment analysis) for identifying Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology-associated differentially methylated probes (DMPs).
